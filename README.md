# TextMiningR-Twiter

This document is aimed to extend our first text mining analysis tutorial. This time, we will use data from twitter web applications and its interaction with R to analyze twitter data. We will do the following:

* Authenticate our twitter account in its developers branch so we can use twitter data
* Loading Packages needed for text manipulation and mining in Twitter
* Text cleaning
* Find frequent words and associations
* Visualize word frequencies with bar plots and wordclouds 
* Cluster our twitter data using k-means function
* Topic Modelling
